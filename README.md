# JarInstall

How to use JarInstall: 

Step 1: Move JarInstall to the desktop and download your Mod Loader (Forge, Fabric, ETC) and move that to your desktop as well. Name the .jar file you downloaded 1.jar and move it to your desktop.

Step 2: Make sure you have an ARM64 or M.X chipset in your Mac (you can check by clicking the apple logo on the top left of your screen and click “About This Mac”)

Step 3: Make sure you have launched the ARM64 Version of Minecraft before. (Do it now if not.) This will install the Java binary necessary for installing .jar files.

Step 4: Launch JarInstall (If you have admin restrictions, right click the file and click “Show Package Contents, copy the files inside and paste them in another folder named ”JarInstall”. Then delete the old folder and rename your new folder and add the .app extension. This will remove the icon, so I provided a .png image of it. Copy it and right click your new JarInstall.app file and click “Get Info” or “cmd + I” and click the missing image and it should get a blue outline. Then paste the image with “cmd + V” and the icon should pop in.)

Step 5: Accept the prompts, and you’re good to go!
