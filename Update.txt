Update 1.3:
- Added a fix to the app not launching on ARM64 Macs.
- Added more prompts to tell users what to do in more detail.
- Added a Finished Prompt.
- added ||exit to the code instead of || exit, since it just quits the app.

Update 2.0: The Biggest Update And Optimization Yet!
- Most code was rewritten to fit in an IF/ELSE statement.
- Reworked functions: JarInstall now REQUIRES the user to put it on the Desktop for one main reason: The program broke when trying to find the java binary when the “1.jar” or        “JarInstall” files were in different directories.
- Faster code execution: (read line 1) Code length was also decreased with the help of Google’s new AI. (As of making this update)
- I will be able to add more good features in the future, since I remembered that VS Code exists.
- Update 2.0 was an overall great update and I will try to update JarInstall soon, but as of right now I am going to slow down with the updates and work more on Optimization.

Update 2.1 - Whoops!
Issue last update: I left my directory in the code so it didn’t work on other computers… Whoops.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Most code was rewritten to fit in 2 IF/ELSE statements.
- Reworked functions: JarInstall now no longer moves the “1.jar“ file from the Desktop to the java binary. You can also choose whether or not to delete the 1.jar file from the desktop now.
- Faster code execution: Code length was increased with the benefit of almost instant execution.
- JarInstall now uses variables to see what you picked. May allow for more choices in the future. Below is the code snippet:
if [ "$result" = "button returned:Yes" ]; then
- Update 2.1 was an overall great update and I will try to update JarInstall soon, but as of right now I am going to slow down with the updates and work more on Optimization. (Nah jk this was in the last update but I’m not slowing down!)
More updates coming soon!
