Update 1.3:
- Added a fix to the app not launching on ARM64 Macs.
- Added more prompts to tell users what to do in more detail.
- Added a Finished Prompt.
- added ||exit to the code instead of || exit, since it just quits the app.

Update 2.0: The Biggest Update And Optimization Yet!
- Most code was rewritten to fit in an IF/ELSE statement.
- Reworked functions: JarInstall now REQUIRES the user to put it on the Desktop for one main reason: The program broke when trying to find the java binary when the “1.jar” or        “JarInstall” files were in different directories.
- Faster code execution: (read line 1) Code length was also decreased with the help of Google’s new AI. (As of making this update)
- I will be able to add more good features in the future, since I remembered that VS Code exists.
- Update 2.0 was an overall great update and I will try to update JarInstall soon, but as of right now I am going to slow down with the updates and work more on Optimization.

More updates coming soon!
